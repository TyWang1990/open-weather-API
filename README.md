# Weather App

## Overview

This repository contains a Python application that retrieves live weather data from openweathermap.org and integrates it into a Streamlit web app. The app provides users with the ability to select a city from dropdown lists and view the current and forecast weather information.

2. Use the dropdown lists to select your desired city.
3. The app will display the current weather conditions and forecast information for the selected city.

## Customization

If you wish to customize the app or incorporate additional features according to your requirements, you can modify the Python script `streamlit_openweather.py`. This script contains customized Python functions that format the raw data obtained from openweathermap.org into the desired format, which is then passed to the Streamlit functions for display.

Feel free to explore and enhance the functionality of the app based on your specific needs.
