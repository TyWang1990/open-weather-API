2. Use the dropdown lists to select your desired city.

## Customization

If you wish to customize the app or incorporate additional features according to your requirements, you can modify the Python script `streamlit_openweather.py`. This script contains customized Python functions that format the raw data obtained from openweathermap.org into the desired format, which is then passed to the Streamlit functions for display.

Feel free to explore and enhance the functionality of the app based on your specific needs.
